                Hii... Developer good morning...
                Today's topic is <strong>History of JavaScript</strong>
            </h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>In early internet used :</p>

            <ul class="blog-ol">
                <li>Markup language : GML(Generalized Markup Language), SGML(Standard Generalized Markup Language)</li>
                <li>Browser : Mosaic</li>
                <li>Script : ECMA(European Computer Manufacturers Association)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>1990's <strong>"Tim Berners Lee"</strong> introduce 'Web & HTML'</p>
            <p>In 1994 Netscape used :
            <ol class="blog-ol">
                <li>Markup language : HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)</li>
                <li>Browser : Netscape communicator</li>
                <li>Script : ECMA(European Computer Manufacturers Association)</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <ul class="blog-li">
                <li> Then Netscape appointed <strong>"Brendan Eich"</strong> to design client side script.</li>
                <li> Brendan eich was build a script language in 1995 and they was given a first name =>
                    <strong>Mocha</strong>.
                </li>
                <li> In 1996 :- They need standardization. So given to ECMA association to build standard for mocha script language.
                </li>
                <li>In 1997 firstly introduce version <strong>Netscape navigator 2.0</strong> script language with
                    standard. And then changed the name <strong>Mocha => 'Live Script'.</strong></li>
                <li> After that second version was released in 1998 and third 1999. </li>
                <li> In 2000 Netscape given responsibility to SMS(Sun Mirco System).</li>
                <li> Sum Micro System company was changed the name. The Name was <strong>JavaScript</strong>. At that time Java language is very popular. So they kept the name was JavaScript. </li>
                <li> That name does not any sense to Java, because java is different language, with different capibilities and JavaScript is also different.</li>
                <li> So maybe they can grap the popularity. So they kept the name. That is not wrong but today's name is very good behind the story was different.</li>
                <li> After some time he was decided. Whose....? </li>
                <li> Ooo... man sum micro system. The system retreat away from taking responsibility for JavaScript. He give responsibility to ECMA.</li>
                <li> Don't be Shock... ðŸ˜® like this. Yes ECMA in early time we used for scripting language. They used for scripting language.</li>
                <li> By the way what is script? don't worry i explain => Script capability to run indivisually and integreted into any other technology.</li>
                <li> So... finally took responsibility ECMA of JavaScript.</li>
                <li> After that, he released many version of JavaScript just as - ES4, ES5(2009), ES6(17 June,2015).</li>
                <li> ES6 version is very popular and has big changes of in JavaScript. </li>
                <li> Up to 2022, ES13 is available.</li>
                <li> ECMAScript 2022 (ES13) is the 13th edition of the ECMAScript standard that preceded the current ECMAScript 2023 (ES14).</li>

                <li> I hope you understand all thing. For better remember that all things you should write a blog on the 'history of JavaScript' in your own way, what you have understood.</li>
