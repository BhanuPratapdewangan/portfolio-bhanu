                Hii... Developer good morning...
                Today's topic is <strong>History of JavaScript</strong>
            </h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>In early internet used :</p>
            <p>
            <ol class="blog-ol">
                <li>Markup language : GML(Generalized Markup Language), SGML(Standard Generalized Markup Language)</li>
                <li>Browser : Mosaic</li>
                <li>Script : ECMA(European Computer Manufacturers Association)</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>1990's <strong>"Tim Berners Lee"</strong> introduce 'Web & HTML'</p>
            <p>In 1994 Netscape used :
            <ul class="blog-ol">
                <li>Markup language : HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)</li>
                <li>Browser : Netscape communicator</li>
                <li>Script : ECMA(European Computer Manufacturers Association)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>- Then Netscape appointed <strong>"Brendan Eich"</strong> to design client side script</p>
            <p>- Brendan eich was build a script language in 1995 and they was given a first name =>
                <strong>Mocha</strong></p>
            <p>- In 1996 :- They need standardization. So given to ECMA association to build standard for mocha script
                language </p>
            <p>- In 1997 firstly introduce version <strong>Netscape navigator 2.0</strong> script language with
                standard. And then changed the name <strong>Mocha => 'Live Script'.</strong></p>
            <p>- After that second version was released in 1998 and third 1999 </p>
            <p>- In 2000 Netscape given responsibility to SMS(Sun Mirco System)</p>
            <p>- Sum Micro System company was changed the name. </p>
            <p>- Name was <strong>JavaScript</strong>. At that time Java language is very popular. So they kept the name
                was JavaScript. </p>
            <p>- That name does not any sense to Java, because java is different language, with different capibilities
                and javascript is also different.</p>
            <p>- So maybe they can grap the popularity. So they kept the name.</p>
            <p>- That is not wrong but today's name is very good behind the story was different. </p>
            <p>- After some time he was decided. Whose....? </p>
            <p>- Ooo... man sum micro system. The system retreat away from taking responsibility for JavaScript. He give
                responsibility to ECMA</p>
            <p>- Don't be Shock... ðŸ˜® like this. Yes ECMA in early time we used for scripting language. They used for
                scripting language</p>
            <p>- By the way what is script? don't worry i explain => Script capability to run indivisually and
                integreted into any other technology</p>
            <p>- So... finally took responsibility ECMA of javascript</p>
            <p>- After that, he released many version of javascript just as - ES4, ES5(2009), ES6(17 June,2015)</p>
            <p>- ES6 version is very popular and has big changes of in javascript </p>
            <p>- Up to 2022, ES13 is available</p>
            <p>- ECMAScript 2022 (ES13) is the 13th edition of the ECMAScript standard that preceded the current
                ECMAScript 2023 (ES14)</p>

            <p>I hope you understand all thing. For better remember that all things you should write a blog on the
                'history of javascript' in your own way, what you have understood.</p>
